    <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
    
    <h2>Site Usage Agreement</h2>
    
    <p>By using this site and/or downloading any material, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. This agreement applies to you and, if you are using this web site on your client's behalf, to you and all your clients. We reserve the right to change this agreement at any time without further notice. We reserve the right to update and/or change our pricing structure as needed including but not limited to changes based on our community, imagery database or market trends. Your use of the site will be subject to the most current version posted on the site at the time of your use. By using this site or downloading, uploading or using any images listed under the Skypiea.co domain you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Should you disagree with anything stated here please discontinue your use of the site and erase all data you have downloaded. Where Skypiea has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the page or site's functionalities, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Skypiea. If there is any contradiction between the English language version and its translation in a different language, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of this site</h2>
    
    <p>This site is owned and operated by Skypiea. All images and related informational materials in any medium provided by Skypiea hereunder, including related text, captions, or information (collectively referred to as Images) are owned by Skypiea and by our image providers (illustrators), members of our community. All Images are protected by US and international copyright laws.</p>
    
    <p>This site contains both Images that depict a visible watermark (Watermarked Images) and Images that do not contain a visible watermark (Non-Watermarked Images). Skypiea allows you to search for, view, and use Watermarked Images only as permitted below. If you have registered for a Skypiea account and Skypiea has approved your registration, you may be able to access Non-Watermarked Images, which shall be used only as permitted below. Skypiea reserves the right to revoke your authorization to view, download and use the Images and information available on this site at any time, and you agree to immediately discontinue your such use upon written notice from Skypiea. All rights not specifically granted under this Agreement are reserved to Skypiea. Additionally, we do not allow the use of automated software or other crawling techniques for searching our web site and/or retrieve Images or related information.</p>
    
    <p>Skypiea may immediately revoke all licenses granted to you without notice if you fail to comply with any provision of this agreement. If a license is revoked, you agree to immediately stop using this site and the Images, delete all Images and all copies from all media and destroy all other copies. Your use of this site and any Images shall comply with all applicable law. Skypiea may restrict or remove your access to this site at any time, or restrict or remove the use of any Image for any reason, and may replace the Image with another Image, and you agree to immediately discontinue all use of the Image upon notification from Skypiea.</p>
    
    <p>Despite our best efforts to provide accurate information, this site may contain technical or other mistakes, inaccuracies or typographical errors. Additionally, this site and any Images may include historically and culturally important images and text that may contain subjects that reflect the social attitudes and circumstances of a particular time or location. You should be aware that your search may display results containing content that may seem inappropriate to its context, or text that could be potentially offensive. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any Image requires the consent of any third party or the license of any additional rights, and you should not rely solely on the information provided by Skypiea or its members. If you are unsure whether additional third-party rights are needed for your use, you are responsible for consulting with competent rights management professionals or legal counselors.</p>
    
    <p>Skypiea makes reasonable efforts to comply with and solve all issues regarding potential copyrights and trademarks available on the US and international market. While the responsibility for the images uploaded is entirely on the illustrator's side, he/she being the one who holds all copyrights over the content submitted, we do our best to identify and solve any copyright or trademark infringements.
    If you have found a file that represents such an infringement please notify us, in order that we may take the appropriate measures.</p>
    
    <h2>Children</h2>
    
    <p>Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use this site unsupervised and we ask that children do not register for an account or submit any personal information to us. By using this site unsupervised, and/or registering for an account, you warrant that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>
    
    <h2>Acknowledgements, Representations, and Warranties</h2>
    
    <p>By using the Website or any other of Our services, You thereby affirmatively acknowledge, represent, and warrant the truth and accuracy of each of the following statements:</p>
    
    <ol type="a">
    <li><p>Skypiea provides access to an online service comprising information and materials created and posted by You and other users.</p></li>
    <li><p>Images on the Website that are available for license are stored on Skypiea’s servers at the direction of Skypiea’s users.</p></li>
    <li><p>Any modification of Images uploaded by Skypiea’s users, such as the addition of a Skypiea watermark, is performed by an automated process. Accordingly, as the Contributor is aware that such modifications shall take place automatically upon upload, the Contributor shall be deemed the party responsible for such automatic modification and shall be considered the “author” of such automatically modified Image. Skypiea is not responsible for modifications that occur to Images as part of its automatic posting process.</p></li>
    <li><p>Any review of uploaded Images that may be performed by Skypiea before making such Images available to the public is cursory and only intended to identify immediately obvious violations of these Terms. Accordingly, and despite any such gate keeping, the Contributor uploading an Image shall be deemed the party at whose direction that Image resides on Skypiea’s servers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Skypiea has never directed, and never will direct, its users to upload Images that infringe upon any right belonging to a third party. Uploading Images that infringe on third-party rights constitutes a direct and material violation of these express Terms and will subject the uploading Contributor’s account to suspension and/or termination, where appropriate.</p></li>
    <li><p>Skypiea correctly presumes that the Contributor uploading an Image is the sole holder of all exclusive rights to that Image, except where the Image alone bears some obvious indication to the contrary, such as a visible proprietary marking identifying a Person other than the Contributor as the exclusive rights holder.</p></li>
    <li><p>Where an Image has no obvious proprietary marking that indicates an exclusive owner, Skypiea cannot be deemed to have actual knowledge that the Image infringes upon any third party’s rights.</p></li>
    <li><p>In collecting license fees on behalf of Contributors, and retaining a portion of those license fees, Skypiea does not derive a direct financial benefit from any particular Image. Skypiea’s only direct financial benefit comes from operating its Website, which allows Contributors to market their Images to potential license purchasers. Contributors are the only parties receiving a direct financial benefit from their creation and uploading of Images for licensing by Skypiea’s users.</p></li>
    <li><p>Skypiea has no right or ability to control the activities of Contributors who create and upload images to the Website. In the event that a Contributor infringes upon a third party’s rights by creating or uploading an image, that Contributor is the sole responsible party for such infringement, and Skypiea has no control over such activity.</p></li>
    <li><p>Apart from identifying an obvious proprietary marking in an Image that indicates an exclusive owner, Skypiea has no other ability to determine whether the rights appurtenant to a particular Image may belong to a party other than the uploading Contributor. As its only other means of identifying Images that may infringe upon a third party’s rights, Skypiea relies entirely on properly presented notifications from third parties claiming that their rights have been violated.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h2>Use of Watermarked Images - Using images for comping</h2>
    
    <p>Images include without limitation all digital images and any related textual information (including captions and credits). Images include visibly or electronically watermarked and reduced resolution Images (Non-Watermarked or Watermarked Images) or higher resolution non-watermarked Images (Non-Watermarked Images).
    Conditional upon your compliance with this Agreement, Skypiea grants you a limited license to download Watermarked Images solely for evaluating/comping whether you wish to purchase a license to the Non-Watermarked Image according to the Standard Terms and Conditions applicable to your use. You may not use a Watermarked Image in any final materials distributed within your company or any materials distributed outside of your company or to the public or in any online or other electronic distribution system. You may not modify, alter, or remove any visible or electronic watermark, or disassemble, reverse engineer, or decompile any Image. Except for this limited, internal testing and sample use, Skypiea grants you no other rights, and you may not distribute, sublicense or make available for use or distribution any Watermarked Image.</p>
    
    <h2>Registering For A Skypiea Account</h2>
    
    <p>To obtain access to our images as well as upload any images, you have to apply for a Skypiea account and you agree to provide complete, true and accurate information. Skypiea reserves sole discretion over whether to grant you an account, and you agree to access the authorized sections of the web site and your account only by using the account number and password supplied to you by Skypiea. Our privacy policy can be reviewed at the following link.</p>
    
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account number and/or password, if applicable, and you shall not distribute this access information or allow others to use this access information to gain access to this site. You agree to take reasonable steps to prevent others from obtaining your access information and to notify Skypiea of any unauthorized access or need to update or remove access for any of your employees or agents. You shall be liable for payment for all Images downloaded by others using your account, with or without your permission or knowledge prior to the time that you notify Skypiea of any unauthorized use. You agree that you shall not acquire any rights of use, ownership, or bailment as a result of using any Skypiea account or web site or related services.
    At anytime, you may request your account access to be restricted, but Skypiea reserves the right to delay your request until all requirements of this Agreement are met. Only accounts without any activity related to the site's services or products, can be permanently deleted. Accounts with activity will be blocked and archived on our servers for further reference. Access to these accounts is limited and provided only to a part of the Skypiea admin staff, for legal purposes.</p>
    
    <p>After acquiring a credits package or subscription, you can download images using various licenses available on our site. These licenses are awarded to the account owner (person or organization). This is a one-person license and can be used only by the account owner or his employee, for the company's own projects or clients and cannot be transmitted to another party. If the image is to be used by more employees, then an Unlimited Extended License (U-EL) is required.</p>
    
    <p>None of our images may be resold or redistributed by any means, or made available for redistribution or resale by a third party without Skypiea's separate written consent.</p>
    
    <h2>Royalty-Free License - Concept Info</h2>
    
    <p>What Royalty-Free means is that you pay for the image only once and then you can use it as many times as you like, with just a few restrictions. In other words, there are no license fees except the initial fee and no other royalties to be paid except those included in the initial cost. Note that the maximum number of copies for printed materials is 500,000 copies.</p>
    
    <p>The Royalty-Free license is granted ONLY for the non-watermarked image you buy using the Download button; all the other versions (small watermarked and non-watermarked thumbnails which are visible on the public site) are entirely copyrighted.</p>
    
    <p>The free files downloaded from the Free Photos section may be used in commercial projects under our limited Royalty Free (RF-LL) license and according to our terms and conditions. This is a one-person license and is given to you as a designer, your employer (client) or any employed persons.</p>
    
    <h2>Royalty- Free License of use of Non-Watermarked Images and Restrictions</h2>
    
    <p>The high-resolution images that you download under the regular Royalty Free (RF) license may be used to make fine art prints, on a web site, in a magazine, newspaper, book or booklet, book cover, flyer, application software (apps) or any other advertising and promotional material, in either printed or electronic media, as long as the item in which the image appears does not contradict any of the restrictions below. The list is not exhaustive and if you have any uncertainty regarding the use of the images in a correct way please email support using the help form.</p>
    
    <p>Web templates, greeting cards or postcards especially designed for sale, similar print-on-demand services, canvas, t-shirts, mugs, calendars, postcards, mouse pads or any other items incorporating the image in an essential manner, intended to be sold are considered redistribution (if the image is used in an essential manner). The use of Skypiea.co images for these purposes under the regular Royalty Free license is not permitted. It is also forbidden to make the image available on a website for download (as wallpapers for example), although you may use the image in a concept in as many websites as you want, for any number of clients. For Web use, you must not use the image at a width exceeding 800 pixels unless it is included in your site's design. If the image is part of a design and manipulated accordingly, the image width can be higher than 800 pixels.</p>
    
    <p>If you use the images for printed materials, the number of copies must not exceed 500,000. You may modify the images in any way required for reproduction, or include them in your own personal creations.</p>
    
    <p>Buying the high-resolution image (purchasing the license) does not transfer the copyright. You may not claim that the image is your own and you may not sell, license for use, or in any way distribute the image for reuse. We recommend that you credit the agency and the illustrator when you use an image. By this you benefit the community at Skypiea.co, of which you are an integral part, and help increase your success as part of the community, which, by growing contributions, gains quantity and quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Limited Royalty Free Licenses (RF-LL) for using images downloaded within the Free section of the website</h2>
    
    <p>Skypiea offers a free section, fully searchable and constantly updated. Its use may be available to all registered users or to a specific niche of members, depending on the agency's strategy. The high resolution images downloaded from the free section may be used under the terms mentioned for the regular Royalty Free license, with a single additional restriction: the maximum amount of copies is limited to 10,000 copies. If you exceed this amount and you already purchased credits you may request to download the image under the regular RF license.</p>
    
    <h2>Editorial License:</h2>
    
    <p>The editorial section provides news worthy images reflecting events from social, cultural and political scenes. Images downloaded under the Editorial section of our site, as well as images downloaded with our Royalty Free license can be used within editorial context as long as the current terms are met. Sensitive usage restrictions also apply.</p>
    
    <p>The high-resolution images that you download with the editorial license may be used to illustrate truthful articles or broadcasts appearing in magazines, newspapers or any other editorial context, in either printed or electronic media. Buying the high-resolution image (purchasing the license) does not transfer the copyright. You may not claim that the image is your own and you may not sell, license for use, or in any way distribute the image. Click here for Credit line requirements.</p>
    
    <p>Special ethical considerations apply to editorial usage. When using or submitting editorial images, you are solely responsible for any claims related to or arising from any visual adjustments of the images. Standard manipulation such as cropping the image or regular brightness/contrast corrections are allowed only if doing this will not affect the visual message of the image. We reserve the right to refuse any image submission that we consider as not marketable.</p>
    
    <h2>Additional requirements for buyers:</h2>
    
    <p>Images included within the editorial section may include visible logos, or identifiable persons who didn't sign a character release document. You are solely responsible for the usage given to such images. Please consider that editorial images are not meant for commercial usage and using them in a commercial context is against editorial terms.</p>
    
    <h2>Extended Licenses for Using Our Imagery</h2>
    
    <p>The following licenses offer extended types of usage for our regular Royalty Free or Editorial licenses. Note that not all images are available for this type of license. You may use the image according to the following licenses only if the image was available under the appropriate license AND you downloaded it using the appropriate download button. <strong>You can view the license for each image you downloaded in your Management Area / My Downloads.</strong></p>

    <h2>Web Usage (W-EL):</h2>
    
    <p>Electronic Items for Resale/Distribution: this license includes the right to use the photos for webtemplates that are sold to more customers, screensavers, e-cards, powerpoint presentations or as wallpapers on cell phones. Maximum number of electronical items is 10,000 copies (applies as a total of each type of usage). If this amount is exceeded you need to acquire this license once again.

    <h2>Sell the Rights (SR-EL):</h2>
    
    <p>This license represents a full ownership of the downloaded image. The buyer can use it exclusively (exclusivity applies from the moment that the file was downloaded using this license; buyer must take into account potential past downloads made for the image and choose it accordingly or investigate further via support), and include it in any type of design with just a few restrictions: sensitive subjects may still apply and the buyer may not claim that the file was created by him nor resell it as a photo. The agency will disable the image immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The illustrator is required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occurred, but no longer than 72 hours. This license grants the buyer exclusivity so the illustrator needs to keep in mind that an exclusive image is represented by concepts, characters, wardrobe, and subject matter which provide a unique creative message and small variations in the image (variations in camera angle, character posture or gesture, for example) do not enable other files as being different. All such variations rendering the images very similar in concept and message to the one sold under SR-EL should be removed from sale as well. The illustrator acknowledge and agrees to provide the buyer with full ownership for the file retrieved using the SR-EL license.</p>
    
    <h2>Time Limited Exclusivity (SR-EL1, SR-EL3):</h2>
    
    <p>This license represents an exclusive right to use the downloaded image, but such exclusivity will only last for a limited period of time. The buyer can use the image exclusively (exclusivity applies from the moment that the file was downloaded using this license) during the time period selected, and include it in any type of design with just a few restrictions: sensitive subjects may still apply and the buyer may not claim that the file was created by him nor resell it as a photo.
    Skypiea will disable the image immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The Contributor will be required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he or she may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occured, but no longer than 72 hours. The Contributor acknowledges and agrees to provide the buyer with the exclusive right to use the file retrieved using the SR-EL1 or SR-EL3 licenses, for the duration of the selected exclusivity period.
    The length of time for the exclusivity period depends on which license is selected. SR-EL1 will grant an exclusive right to use the image for one year. Similarly, SR-EL3 will grant an exclusive right to use the image for three years. The print run for both licenses is unlimited and continues after the exclusivity expired. At the end of the exclusivity period, the buyer`s license will continue as before, with all of the same rights, except for the right of exclusivity, and the image will again be added to the available library of images on Skypiea.co and again be made available to all users for purchase. After the end of the exclusivity period, the Contributor will also be free to offer the image for download from other places where the Contributor sells his or her images.</p>
    
    <p>If a character Release is available on file, it will remain within our database, a proof about its existence can be forwarded to the buyer, however, the MR info will still not be disclosed in respect of the illustrators' and characters' privacy.
    These are additional licenses to the rights included within the regular Royalty-Free license.</p>
    
    <p>For any other details regarding usage or these licenses, you are strongly advised to contact Skypiea.</p>
    
    <h2>Unauthorized Use</h2>
    
    <p>Without limitation, Images may not be used as a trademark or service mark (unless the appropriate extended license is being used), for any pornographic or unlawful purpose, to defame a person, to violate a person's right to privacy or publicity, to infringe upon any copyright, trade name, trademark, or service mark of any person/entity. Unauthorized use of these Images constitutes copyright infringement and shall entitle Skypiea to exercise all rights and remedies under applicable copyright law, including an injunction preventing further use and monetary damages against all users and beneficiaries of the use of such Images. The foregoing is not a limiting statement of Skypiea's rights or remedies in connection with any unauthorized use.</p>
    
    <h2>Credit Line Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>All images used within editorial context or related must be accompanied by a visible credit line. You are required to include a copyright notice and author/agency credit next to each image used within editorial purposes. The credit line format is specified on the Download page.</p>

    <h2>Notification of copyright infringement</h2>
    
    <p>Skypiea may terminate the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on Skypiea's site, send Skypiea a notice containing: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed and identification of what material in such work(s) is claimed to be infringing; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Skypiea site; (iv) information sufficient to permit Skypiea to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material you identified is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vii) a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.</p>
    
    <h2>No Waiver / Severability</h2>
    
    <p>No action of Skypiea, other than an express written Waiver or Amendment, may be construed as a waiver or amendment of this Site Usage Agreement. Should any clause of this Agreement be found unenforceable, wherever possible this will not affect any other clause and each will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    
    <h2>Contributors rights &amp; obligations</h2>
    
    <p>Contributors are required to keep at least seventy (70%) percent of their portfolio online with Skypiea.co for a period of at least six (6) months. You may disable all files older than six months from the date of review at any time. You will be allowed to disable a total of thirty (30%) percent of your total images submitted within the past six (6) months. Images that were disabled and then enabled again will be counted as new submissions, no matter of their original upload date.</p>
    
    <p>Contributors shall receive a percentage (a Revenue Share) from each sale made by Skypiea on their behalf as described in the paragraphs below. Considering the dynamic nature of the industry, Skypiea and its distributors, affiliates, referrals etc. can represent the illustrators using different marketing techniques or characters (such as credit based or subscription payment plans, third party distributors etc.). Contributor acknowledges and agrees that each of these varied marketing techniques and characters may result in different net sale prices for the same image under each set of circumstances. The paragraphs below mention the minimum Revenue Share that is to be awarded to a Contributor from the net sale price collected for the Contributor's image, unless otherwise mentioned in different areas of the site (such as the Alliances section or Sell your images section). Revenue Shares are calculated based on net sales amounts after payment of referral fees, as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided Contributor is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Skypiea will not seek repayment of any overpayments made to Contributor. No Contributor shall be entitled to receive payment, nor shall Skypiea be liable for any such payment, unless and until the total amount of that Contributor’s unpaid earnings exceeds One Hundred U.S. Dollars (US$100.00).</p>
    
    <p>Contributors are not allowed to download their portfolio (partly or completely) , especially if this is performed in order to take advantage of any available discounts and bonuses provided by Skypiea.co. Contributors who lost their own images during a hardware failure are asked to contact support in order to receive a copy of their own files.</p>
    
    <p>Exclusive images: A contributor may work with other agencies in addition to Skypiea.co. However, the images provided to Skypiea.co and marked as being exclusive are sold only on Skypiea.co. An exclusive image is represented by concepts, characters, wardrobe, and subject matter which provide a unique creative message and small variations in the image (variations in camera angle, character posture or gesture, for example) do not enable an image as being different. Exclusive images may only be sold through Skypiea.co and may not be offered through other channels. Contributors shall receive 70% of the net sale price received by Skypiea.co for the exclusive images they have contributed to the site which are subsequently sold by Skypiea.co. A Contributor may remove the exclusivity rights to an image with thirty (30) days prior written notice to Skypiea.co.</p>
    
    <p>If a contributor breaks this Exclusivity Agreement, Skypiea.co reserves the right to invalidate and recover all earnings made by that Contributor through Skypiea.co sales commencing with the date the exclusive image or images or portfolio were made subject to the Exclusivity Agreement.</p>
    
    <p>Skypiea.co reserves the right to take any actions that it deems necessary to protect its rights, all rights of which are specifically reserved.</p>
